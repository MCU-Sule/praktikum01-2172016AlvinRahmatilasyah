           <p align = "center"><strong>We'll begin with a box, and the plural is boxes, <br>
              But the plural of ox becames oxen, not oxes. <br>
              One fowl is a goose, but two are called geese, <br>
              Yet the plural of moose should never be meese. <br>
              You may find a lone mouse or a nest full of mice, <br>
              Yet the plural of house is houses, not hice. <br>

        <p align = "center"> <strong><U>If</U> the plural of man is always called men, <br>
            Why shouldn't the plural of pan be called pen?<br>
             <u>If</u> I speak of my foot and show you my feet, <br>
              And I give you a boot, would a pair be called beet? <br>
              <u>If</u> one is a tooth and a whole set are teeth, <br>
              why shouldn't the plural of booth be called beeth? </strong></p><br></font>
           <font size = "2">
        <p align = "center"> Then one may be that, and three would be those, <br>
            Yet hat in the plural would never be hose, <br>
            And the plural of cat is cats, not cose. <br>
            We speak of a brother and also of brethren, <br>
            But though we say mother, we never sat mathren. <br>
            Then the masculine pronouns are he, his and him, <br>
